# Manifesto for Facebook Democracy

The idea behind this manifesto is to create an open organization with the intent of providing, maintaning and audinting a democratic platform built upon the Facebook social network. Where pages would act as organizations providing users the capability of voting on issues that matter to them. Like universities, non-profit organizations, political parties and any type of organization which wants users to engage more with the decision making process in a way that is already familiar to them.

To achieve this goal we would make the Facebook the center of the democratic experience, using all features and services provided by Facebook. However, all votes, delegations and auditing process would be externaly, so we can control the process over letting Facebook do the calculations. Also, because the UI affects a lot how users think and vote, we would display the issues and their disussions on a separated interface accessible via links shared on Facebook.

We expect that with that we may be able to spread the idea of Liquid Democracy and make it a part of the everyday life. Introducing people to a new platform is always difficult, so why not make use of the existing ones? And because of its spread and influence we think that Facebook is the perfect one for this.

## Draft

I would like to present a draft on how to make this proposal a reality. The project is on its embrionary stage, so don't expect that all solutions would be presented here, on the contrary, I am proposing a discussion so we can figure out the problems before starting writing any software.
