# Manifesto for Facebook Democracy

The idea behind this manifesto is to create an open organization with the intent of providing, maintaning and auditing a democratic platform built upon the Facebook social network. Where pages would act as organizations providing users the capability of voting on issues that matter to them. Like universities, non-profit organizations, political parties and any type of organization which wants users to engage more with the decision making process in a way that is already familiar to them.

To achieve this goal we would make the Facebook the center of the democratic experience, using all features and services provided by Facebook. However, all votes, delegations and auditing process would be externaly, so we can control the process over letting Facebook do the calculations. Also, because the UI affects a lot how users think and vote, we would display the issues and their disussions on a separated interface accessible via links shared on Facebook.

We expect that with that we may be able to spread the idea of Liquid Democracy and make it a part of the everyday life. Introducing people to a new platform is always difficult, so why not make use of the existing ones? And because of its spread and influence we think that Facebook is the perfect one for this.

## Draft

I would like to present a draft on how to make this proposal a reality. The project is on its embrionary stage, so don't expect that all solutions would be presented here, on the contrary, I am proposing a discussion so we can figure out the problems before starting writing any software.

### User Interface and Experience

As mentioned previously, the Facebook will be the main point of experience, all actions and notifications will derive and be presented on it. Where the page will act as the organization, the users as the voters and delegators and the Facebook as the voting system. In order to achieve that, I have thinked about this requirements:

#### Requirements

- Users should be allowed to use their own Facebook's profile
- Users should be able to see their voting record from their Facebook's profile
- Users should be able to see other voting records (on Facebook, if possible)
- Users should be able to delegate their vote to other users (on Facebook, if possible) 
- Users should be notificated about the effects any decision made by them of by their delegated on Facebook
- Users should be able to change their vote at any time before the closing of that issue
- Facebook pages should be able to decide which users should be able to vote
- Facebook pages shoud be able to decide whether users can open issues or not

### Facebook Integration

#### Requirements
- The Facebook ID would be used to identify the users vote and if they could or not vote on topics discussed on a specific page.
- The policy should be associated with a post from the Facebook
- The should be dynamic in a way that the user could see a summary of the policy being voted
- The user should click on call-to-action button and then vote on the policy page
- The user should receive a message on his Facebok inbox showing his delegator has cast a vote
- When someone cast a vote directly, we should be able to post it on Facebook
