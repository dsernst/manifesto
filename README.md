# EN: Manifesto for Facebook Democracy

In light of the recent world evens, I would like to propose a project with the intent of making the Facebook a Liquid Democracy tool. 
Which means to make use of all availble platforms, features and APIs to create all functiolaties and experiences needed to run a 
democratic voting process. This includes polls, discussion, direct voting, voting delegation and tools for transparency and accountability.

The reason for using the Facebook as a platform come from its onipresence and impact on social matters, seem on the Fake News scandal
and in many other ways its has been influencing the way we think. Better than ignoring the problem, I propose turning it to an amazing
solution. Want it or not, Facebook is a political tool. And would be better that an open-source project reveal its full potential rather than
someone political's ambitions. Starting the narrative and proposing the solution may put the liquid democracy idea on the public's mind,
and thats for itself is a huge step.

I think the first step would be create an team and do a lot of research work, then start building some prototypes and testing on small 
organizations. There are many solutions out there, but none has its focus on integrating with Facebook. So we would first think about
how to adapt some solutions already developed, DemocracyOS for example, and then see what fits better for the Facebook User.

I don't expect that we will be definitive solution, but I really think that the open-source community should start the dialog. I really woundn't
like leave it for the big companies.

So, if you want to contribute please get in touch.
